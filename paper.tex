\begin{abstract}
 
%Recent exploitations, hardware-based malware and privacy breaches show that the concept of a powerful adversary who can completely compromise a host (computer) system (hardware, operating system, and installed applications) is not far fetched. \emph{Security} and \emph{safety-critical} \emph{remote} applications such as e-voting, financial transitions, various industrial control systems, medical devices, and home automation systems rely upon user interaction that is typically transmitted through web applications. A compromised host can either observe or manipulate these data. And by doing so, it can cause catastrophic failure in the safety-critical systems, theft of identity and financial information, thus making this problem a uniquely challenging one.

\emph{Security} and \emph{safety-critical} \emph{remote} applications such as e-voting, financial transitions, various industrial control systems, medical devices, and home automation systems rely upon user interaction that is typically transmitted through web applications. Trusted path to such remote systems is critical in the presence of an attacker that compromises the computers that the user utilizes since such an attacker can observe and modify the IO signals. There exist many proposed systems in the recent literature that try to solve the integrity and confidentiality of user IO. But none of them provides a generic, secure solution as they failed to realize the fundamental security properties, i) without preserving both output and input integrity, none of them can be achieved, and ii) all the input modalities are needed to be protected.    

\name, our proposed solution is based on this idea, and it ensures the integrity and confidentiality of user's IO utilizing a trusted low-TCB external device that sits between the attacker-controlled host and all the IO devices. Today's off-the-shelf commodity hardware could easily integrate \name with little or no changes into the system. \name generates proofs for all IO interactions between the user and the remote end-system that the user is accessing. \name captures the display signal, hence efficiently determines the current user context and intentions, and determines if the user input is tampered with by the malicious host or network. Thus, \name provides a generic and usable trusted path for all IO devices.
