\begin{abstract}

Recent exploitations, hardware-based malwares and privacy breaches shows that the concept of powerful adversary who can completely compromise a host system (hardware, operating system and installed applications) is not far fetched. Security, privacy and safety critical applications such as e-voting, financial transitions, various industrial control systems, medical devices and home automation systems relies user interaction that are typically transmitted through web applications. A compromised host can either manipulate or steal these data by doing so it can cause catastrophic failure in the safety-critical systems, theft of identity and/or financial information, thus making this problem an uniquely challenging one.

In this paper, we propose \name, a system that introduces three security properties concerning input, output, and activity. \name provides these security propertied that can be fined tuned based on the application requirements such as input privacy/integrity, output privacy/integrity and activity integrity. All of these security properties are ensured under the attacker model that compromises the host system entirely.
