\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, \name provides a remote trusted path in the presence of an attacker-controlled host. \name provides integrity and confidentiality protection for both input and output simultaneously. Furthermore, \name also protects all modalities of input sources. In this process, \name introduces no cognitive load on the users when providing integrity protection and low cognitive load for confidentiality. We also present a working prototype of \name that is easy to deploy in the real world.
