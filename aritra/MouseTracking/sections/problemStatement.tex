\label{sec:problemStatement}

The problem that we try to solve is the following

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Integrity of the input device data (keyboard, mouse\ldots) and corresponds it to the frame data (of the display device) in the presence of an attacker-controlled host system.
  \item Installation of a single device, no change in any of the existing system/software or human interactions.
\end{enumerate}
