\title{\name: Root-of-Trust for IO}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
 
Recent exploitations, hardware-based malware and privacy breaches show that the concept of a powerful adversary who can completely compromise a host system (hardware, operating system, and installed applications) is not far fetched. \emph{Security, privacy} and \emph{safety-critical} \emph{remote} applications such as e-voting, financial transitions, various industrial control systems, medical devices, and home automation systems rely upon user interaction that is typically transmitted through web applications. A compromised host can either manipulate or steal these data by doing so it can cause catastrophic failure in the safety-critical systems, theft of identity and financial information, thus making this problem a uniquely challenging one.

In this paper, we propose \name, a system brings \emph{root-of-trust} into the IO devices by introducing integrity and privacy properties to them. All of these security properties are ensured under the attacker model that compromises the host system entirely. Today's off-the-shelf commodity hardware could easily integrate \name with little or no changes into the system. We implement \name using a low-TCB auxiliary device that acts as a trusted mediator all the IO devices and the compromised host. \name generate proofs for all IO interactions between the user and the remote end-system that the user is accessing. \name capture the display signal, hence efficiently determine the current user context and intentions, and determine if the user input is tampered with by the malicious host or network. Thus, \name provides a generic and usable trusted path for all IO devices.
