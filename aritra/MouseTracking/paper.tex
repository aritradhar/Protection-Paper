\begin{abstract}
 

\emph{Security} and \emph{safety-critical} remote applications such as e-voting, online banking, industrial control systems, medical devices, and home automation systems rely upon user interaction that is typically performed through web applications. Trusted path to such remote systems is critical in the presence of an attacker that controls the computer that the user operates. Such a powerful attacker can observe and modify any IO data without being detected by the user or the server. We investigate the security of previous research proposals that address this problem and observe several drawbacks that make them vulnerable to advanced UI manipulation attacks. Based on these observations we define a novel set of requirements for secure IO operation in the presence of a compromised host.
  
We propose \name, a system that ensures the integrity \red{and confidentiality} of the user's IO employing a trusted low-TCB device that sits between the attacker-controlled host and the IO devices. Therefore, \name device can intercept the display signal and user inputs from the keyboard and mouse. Furthermore, it can overlay secure UI on top of the HDMI frames generated by the untrusted host. \name requires small changes in the server-side and works with any browser without installing any additional software. \red{For IO integrity protection, \name} does not \red{pose any cognitive load on} the users. \red{However for IO confidentiality, the user needs to executes SAS that is well known in the literature}. Finally, we implement a prototype of \name which is a plug-and-play device and evaluate its performance.
