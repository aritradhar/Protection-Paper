\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\name provides a remote trusted path in the presence of an attacker-controlled host. The guiding principles behind our solutions are that (i) user input and output integrity cannot be considered separately, (ii) all user input modalities must be protected simultaneously, and (iii) user input integrity protection should not rely on user tasks that are prone to habituation and easily forgotten. By following these principles, we design a novel system that provide strong user input integrity protection in the presence of powerful adversary that controls the entire host platform.
