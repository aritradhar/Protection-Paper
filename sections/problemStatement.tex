\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problemStatement}

The problem that we try to solve is the following

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Integrity of the input device data (keyboard, mouse\ldots) and corresponds it to the frame data (of the display device) in the presence of an attacker-controlled host system.
  \item Installation of a single device, no change in any of the existing system/software or human interactions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Attacker Model}

We assume the highly adversarial scenario where the attacker compromises the host system completely (OS, installed applications and hardware). The attacker also controlled the network. We only assume that it is a PPT-attacker, so he can not break crypto. Figure~\ref{fig:approachOverview} depicts the attacker model.

We only assume that the monitor, keyboard, mouse and the \device are trusted. Which is not unrealistic. The monitor, keyboard, and mouse have hardly any complex hardware. The TCB is very small.

\myparagraph{Advantages}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \device does not need to know the formatting/template of the page. As the \device only looks to the current mouse position, the structure of the page is somewhat irrelevant (?).
\end{enumerate}
