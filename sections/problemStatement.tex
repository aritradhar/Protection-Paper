\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problemStatement}

The problem that we try to solve is the following

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Integrity of the input device data (keyboard, mouse\ldots) and corresponds it to the frame data (of the display device) in the presence of an attacker-controlled host system.
  \item Installation of a single device, no change in any of the existing system/software or human interactions.
\end{enumerate}


\myparagraph{Advantages}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \device does not need to know the formatting/template of the page. As the \device only looks to the current mouse position, the structure of the page is somewhat irrelevant (?).
\end{enumerate}
