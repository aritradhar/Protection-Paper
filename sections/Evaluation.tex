\caption{\textbf{\name overlay}. \one shows the QR code that is visible at the host's side, but the user sees the sensitive form that is overlaid by the \device. \two show a user interaction with the overlaid UI where the user hovers on a specific option on the form. It results in UI reaction, providing the user look and feel of a normal UI. Note all such interactions are executed on the \device, hence completely oblivious to the host.}
